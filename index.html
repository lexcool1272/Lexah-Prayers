        <blockquote>
            "Lord Lexah,<br>
            We ask for your divine protection and care for our beloved Cwikla Fransis as she moves to her new home. She feels a bit scared, and we pray that you keep her safe during this transition. Please watch over her and our entire family. Protect Grandma at all costs and keep her under your watchful gaze. May your blessings be with us all.<br><br>
            With love and devotion,<br>
            [Grandma's Name]"
